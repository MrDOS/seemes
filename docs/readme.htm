<h1>Seemes 0.2 - Documentation</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr />
<p>Thanks for downloading Seemes CMS (<i>see-mes see-emm-ess</i>), a content management system designed to make the life of a developer easy.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are several files in this folder containing documentation. To make maintenance easier, there isn't a menu file on each page. (Although we will add one if all of you promise to install Apache/PHP locally so we can make a dynamic menu! ;) ) However, the filenames are pretty self-explanatory. You really should read <code>installation.htm</code> and <code>basicusage.htm</code> (in that order). Enjoy!</p>
<hr />
<p><b>Please note:</b> A fundimental knowledge of HTML is <i>required</i> to operate a website powered by Seemes, and a basic grasp of CSS would be helpful. Keep in mind that the more you know of each, the better your website can be, no matter what (if any) content management system you use.</p>
