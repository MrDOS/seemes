<h1>Seemes 0.2 - Documentation</h1>
<h2>Basic Usage</h2>
<hr />
<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>All the work is done from the <b>Admin Control Panel</b>, which can be accessed through the file <code>admin.php</code> in the folder in which you installed Seemes. To get started, go there and log in. (Your password is the one you gave when you installed.)</p>
<hr />
<h4>Overview of the Admin Control Panel</h4>
<p>The various tasks you can perform in the Admin Control Panel are listed in the menu on the left-hand side of the page. They shoud be pretty much self-explanatory.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Create page:</b> Lets you create a new page.</li>
<li><b>Delete page:</b> Lets you delete an existing page.</li>
<li><b>Edit page:</b> Lets you edit an existing page.</li>
<li><b>Move page:</b> Lets you change the actual filename of an existing page (as opposed to just the title of the page, which can be changed in <b>Edit Page</b>).
<li><b>Edit menu:</b> Lets you edit the menu file, for such things as changing the order of menu items.</li>
<li><b>Manage files:</b> Lets you upload, rename, and delete non-webpage files (e.g. ZIP's, etc.).
<li><b>Change settings:</b> Lets you change a few general settings: the website name, copyright line, theme, and password. <b>Note:</b> if you don't enter a new value for a setting (i.e. you leave the field blank), that setting will not be changed.</li>
<li><b>Log out:</b> Lets you log out of your Admin Control Panel. (Highly recommended on public and shared computers.)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>General information</h4>
<p>The best way to learn to administer Seemes is to play around with it (or wait until better documentation shows up). However, there are a few bits of general information that will help you:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Page filename:</b> This is the actual page filename (e.g. <code>mypage</code>). This is what you'll get when you ask for a <b>Page listing</b>. This is what the system uses and should not be confused with...</li>
<li><b>Page name:</b> The "nice" name of the page (e.g. <code>My Page</code>). This is what the user sees.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h4>Installing Themes</h4>
<p>This is a pretty simple process. Make sure all the theme files are in their correct place on the website. Now, go into your Admin Control Panel, and the <b>Change settings</b> section. Enter a new theme name (with the .txt) and hit <b>Change settings</b>. Now sit back and enjoy your new theme!</p>
