This was probably my first “major” software project.
It was certainly the first time I'd used PHP,
and came on the back of several years of dabbling
in HTML, CSS, a little JavaScript, and
– of course –
unhealthy sums of QBASIC.
Between its release
and whenever I gave up and started using WordPress,
it powered only a couple public websites
(thank goodness none of which were ever exploited!),
but more than that,
provided me with a learning ground
for backend web development.

Look upon the horrors bared within this project
as artifacts of history.
I certainly wouldn't recommend using it.

This project survived
through the magic of [SourceForge.net].
How weird is that?
